# Decision Tree

A decision tree is a supervised machine learning tool used in classification problems to predict the class of an instance. It is a tree like structure where internal nodes of the decision tree test an attribute of the instance and each subtree indicates the outcome of the attribute split. Leaf nodes indicate the class of the instance based on the model of the decision tree.<br />
In this repository you can find the implementation of decision tree and 3 methods `Pruning`, `Random Forest` and `Adaboost` to avoid overfitting and generalisation.
